# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models.

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, class, sex, etc.

## 📊 Dataset
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

- `train.csv`: Training data with labels
- `test.csv`: Test data for prediction

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Evaluation & Prediction

## ✅ Results
- Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~97.2% (update after training)
